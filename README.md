# asset_sim
Attempt at developing an asset price simulator/API in Python

I want to learn to create APIs for data, that I can use to display said data on a website.

Nothing here is to simulate real stock or asset pricing activity, except perhaps in the broadest statistical sense.

Currently, the API just generates IID draws from a standard normal distribution. Over time,
I want to simulate Wiener processes, geometric Brownian motion, along with implementing a streaming
API.
